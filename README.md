# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-Iris-Flower-Classification

This project demonstrates how to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
The model is trained to predict the flower type based on four key features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

  Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn
